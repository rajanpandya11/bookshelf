
## my ideas
* download books on app componentdidmount method
* App component should have the state
* state has list of books, array all_books, each object should have id, name, image, 
    * currently reading, want to read, read; separate arrays for them, they should only have an id of the book, nothing else
* state also has ratings
    * new array, each object should have id and ratings 
* sort facility
* bulk add, new page for that, react router
    * when user clicks on +, it gives two options, add single, add bulk
* add books from internet maybe
* add more category for books to be categorized

## another app 
I want to create an app that does some math for me based on the given ticker
* it should show current price (last, bid, ask)
* secondly should show what analysts are saying (webull has it already but just as)
* it should show me that when should i close this position 
    * based on (radio buttons) whether i wanna go short or long
    * % of profit and the price target when it should be closed at
* it should have ability to save trade
    * so i can keep track 


## todo
* read a book
* call zaiden billing, call fl bcbs, about the 277 bill
